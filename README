Welcome to doodle - A minimal 'framework' for your games, visualisations etc.

Doodle is written in CHICKEN scheme, which is available at
http://www.call-cc.org.

It abstracts simple graphic rountines and window handling on top of
cairo / SDL which should make visualisation tasks and exporting these
drawings as well as writing games more fun and easy.

doodle also provides a simple event loop model which has got its
inspiration from the LUA LÃ¶ve framework, making it easy to do
animations and move sprites around.

Doodle comes with a sprite detection mechanism.

To install doodle you can use CHICKEN schemes chicken-install tool:

$ chicken-install doodle

See the tennis game for an example. You can grab tennis from bitbucket:
